Hi, below are the bullet points:

* Its a program created in Java using TestNG for Data & Test Cases and MAVEN for Jars.

* BowlingGame.java is the main class in which test cases are lying with Data Providers.
* GameRounds.java class file is created to add a method and logic for scores calculation
* GameThrows.java class file is created to add different throwing conditions e.g.:

* X indicates --> STRIKE
